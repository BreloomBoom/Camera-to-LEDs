# Camera-to-LEDs

Just a project I did over the weekend.

Required:
A live video feed (I used iVCam)
win32
pyserial

Takes a video feed from my phone and finds a pixel near the middle, turning it into an rgb value into brightness for 3 LEDs I had set up.

Execute the Arduino code then the python script and if you need change the serial port.
